Approach taken 
------
We started out by coming up with multiple ideas that will suit to the requirement. Upon picking on one of the better idea, we immediately started pitching up on the ERD and wireframe design to have a rough idea on how the website will look like.

After getting the clear for the project, we proceeded to split up the work between us to ensure that no conflict occurs. As we proceed on with the project, we commited regularly and merge regularly so that each of us always have the most updated copy of the project.

Major Hurdles
-----
One major hurdle is that working in a group is way different from working as an individual as we have to make sure that the portion of the application that we are working on will not conflict with one another as we were more used to being able to commit and merge upon our own time instead of having to coordinate with one another so that the conflicts will be resolved quickly if there is any.

Another hurdle is that our project were met with unsatisfactory requirement halfway through the week. It caused a little motivation drop but we were still able to manage to pull through. This is akin and applicable to the real world too as clients may always be changing their expectations and us programmers will have to deal with it in a professional way and still be expected to keep up with the deadline.
